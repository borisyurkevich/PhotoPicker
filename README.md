# PhotoPicker
This proof of concept demonstrates how easy is to use native `UIImagePicker` 
without asking users permission.

Strangely many apps on the app store which use `UIImagePicker` asking
for photo library permission before present it. This apps lie in description that
permission is needed in order to select a photo.

Often this can be avoided with pasting image, but sometimes the only truly private 
way to upload single image is using Safari.
